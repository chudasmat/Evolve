# Evolve

Aiming to be the top decentralised exchange that bridges the gap between teens and decentralised finance.

Our exchange will let an adult verify their identity according to their country's KYC and AML laws, and subsequently allow them to create a profile for their child who can trade currencies, either under parental controls, or independently if the parent wishes. This real-world application will help younger children build a strong base of financial knowledge, to prepare them for the future when they are earning and are responsible for their own finances.

The current foundations are a parachain built on Polkadot, which was made to allow seamless transfers of assets between the child and parent locally, and transfers to other accounts that have joined the permissionless network.
